# Contributing Guide

We would love for you to contribute to this project and help make it even better than it is today! üíé

As a contributor, here are the guidelines we would like you to follow:

- [General Guidelines](#general-guidelines)
- [New Commands Guidelines](#new-command-guidelines)
- [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/permitio/permit-cli/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- [Question or Problem?](#question)
- [Issues and Bugs](#issue)
- [Feature Requests](#feature)

## General Guidelines

- We are encouraging the usage of AI in the development process, but we are also require the human engineering touch on PRs. Every "blind" AI PR will be rejected.
- Permit CLI is based on Pastel.js, and the file structure should adhere the Pastel.js file structure and best practices - to read more about Pastel.js, please visit [Pastel.js](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/pastel?tab=readme-ov-file#table-of-contents) repository.
- The proejct is using typescript and we are using the strict mode, so please make sure to follow the typescript rules. No `any` types are allowed in general.
- The project is using ESLint and Prettier for linting and formatting, and Vitest for testing. 
- All the PRs should pass the lint rules, and provide >90% test coverage of the new code.

### File Structure
- Commands should be placed in the `src/commands` directory. For more guidelines, please refer to the [New Command Guidelines](#new-command-guidelines).
- Components should be placed in the `src/components` directory. Components should be reusable by other commands and should be well documented.
- API Calls should be placed only in hooks, and should be placed in the `src/hooks` directory. The hooks should be well documented and should be reusable by other components.
- The `src/lib` folder is for utility functions that are used across the project. Functions there should be completly pure and do not depend on any external state.
- All the static configuration variables should be placed in the `config.tsx` file.

### Admissions
- We are using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for our commit messages.
- We are using [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) for our releases.
- We try to follow the BetterCLI guidelines, and we are using the [BetterCLI](https://bettercli.dev/) for our CLI development.

## New Command Guidelines

For new commands, we have a few guidelines to ensure consistency and maintainability:
- Command files (placed in `src/commands`), should contain only the argument configuration, and a root command component
- Here are some common guidelines that should be followed when creating a new command:
   - Should be wrapped with the `AuthProvider` component, to ensure the user is authenticated before running the command.
   - Should have an optional `apiKey` argument that allow the user to pass the API key to the command instead of using the login flow provided by the `AuthProvider` component.
   - Should declare the API key scope required for the command (can be `organization`, `project`, or `environment`).
   - Should have concise documentation in the Readme file, explaining the command, its arguments, and how to use it.
   - Should have a `desciption` and `options` object that defines the command's description and arguments.


### Command JSX Structure

The following is a template of a new command. Nothing should be changed or added to this template but the arguments and the root command component.

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import zod from 'zod';
import { option } from 'pastel';
import { AuthProvider } from '../../../components/AuthProvider.js';
// Add the command component import here

export const description =
	'Short and concise description of the command';

export const options = zod.object({
	key: zod
		.string()
		.optional()
		.describe(
			option({
				description:
					'The API key for the permit',
				alias: 'k',
			}),
		),
   // Add more options here
});

type Props = {
	options: zod.infer<typeof options>;
};

export default function GitHub({ options }: Props) {
	return (
		<AuthProvider permit_key={options.apiKey} scope={'the_scope_requires_for_this_command'}> // The scope can be organization, project, or environment
         {/* Add the command component here. Should be single component, with declarative name */}
			<CommandComponent />
		</AuthProvider>
	);
}
```

# AuthProvider Component Documentation

## **Overview**

The `AuthProvider` component is a React context provider designed to manage authentication, authorization, and API key handling for CLI-based workflows. It handles multiple flows, such as login, API key validation, token management, and organization/project/environment selection.

This component is the backbone of authentication for the CLI app. It ensures a smooth and secure authentication process by abstracting away the complexities of API key creation, validation, and token management.

---

## **What It Does**

### **Authentication Flows**

1. **Token Validation:**

   - It attempts to load an existing authentication token using `loadAuthToken()`.
   - If a token exists but has the wrong scope or is invalid, the user is redirected to reauthenticate.

2. **API Key Validation:**

   - The component validates the provided `--key` (if supplied) against the required scope (e.g., organization, project, or environment).
   - If invalid, it throws an error.

3. **Token Creation and Management:**
   - If no key is provided or no stored key is found, we take the user through appropriate selection flow, and get a token of that scope.
   - If while fetching the token, no valid key with name (`CLI_API_Key`) is found, the component handles the creation of a new API key (`CLI_API_Key`), ensuring it is scoped appropriately.

### **User Prompts**

- Prompts users to select an organization or project if required and dynamically handles state transitions based on the user's input.

### **Error Handling**

- Any error in the authentication flow (e.g., invalid token, API failure) is captured and displayed to the user. If an error is critical, the CLI exits with a non-zero status.

---

## **Key Features**

1. **`--key<-->permitKey` Functionality:**

   - Users can pass a `--key` flag to provide an API key directly to the `permitKey` prop of `AuthProvider`. The component validates the key and uses it if valid + has a valid scope.
   - If not passed, the component tries to load a previously stored token or guides the user through a scope based selection and key creation flow.

2. **Scope Handling:**

   - The `scope` prop defines the required level of access (e.g., `organization`, `project`, or `environment`).
   - Based on the scope, the component dynamically fetches or validates the key.

3. **Key Creation:**

   - If on an organization/project scope level, we fetch the key, and we don't find a `CLI_API_Key`, we create one for the user and notify them that it's a secure token and not to edit it in any way.

4. **Error and Loading Indicators:**
   - Displays appropriate messages during loading or error states to ensure users are informed about what‚Äôs happening.

---

## **How to Use It**

- Any component that is wrapped with AuthProvider can use `useAuth()` to access:

```tsx
type AuthContextType = {
	authToken: string;
	loading: boolean;
	error?: string | null;
	scope: ApiKeyScope;
};
```

1. **Wrap Your Application:**

   - The `AuthProvider` should wrap the root of your CLI app. It ensures that authentication is initialized before the app runs.

   ```tsx
   import { AuthProvider } from './context/AuthProvider';

   const App = () => (
   	<AuthProvider scope="project">
   		{' '}
   		// The scope here is optional and defaults to environment
   		<YourCLICommands />
   	</AuthProvider>
   );
   ```

2. **Access Authentication Context:**

   - Use the `useAuth` hook to access the `authToken` and other authentication states in your components.

   ```tsx
   import { useAuth } from './context/AuthProvider';

   const MyCommand = () => {
   	const { authToken, loading, error, scope } = useAuth();

   	if (loading) {
   		return <Text>Loading...</Text>;
   	}

   	if (error) {
   		return <Text>Error: {error}</Text>;
   	}

   	return <Text>Authenticated with token: {authToken}</Text>;
   };
   ```

3. **Customizing Behavior:**
   - Pass the `permit_key` or `scope` prop to customize the authentication flow.
   - Example:
     ```tsx
     <AuthProvider permit_key="my-key" scope="organization">
     	<YourCLICommands />
     </AuthProvider>
     ```

---

## **What Happens Inside**

### **Step-by-Step Breakdown**

1. **Initialization:**

   - Checks if a `permit_key` or token is already available.
   - Validates the token against the required `scope`.

2. **Token Validation:**

   - If invalid or missing, it guides the user through organization/project/environment selection.

3. **API Key Handling:**

   - Searches for an existing `CLI_API_Key` scoped to the organization/project.
   - Creates one if it doesn‚Äôt exist and retrieves its secret.

4. **State Transition:**

   - Handles transitions between `loading`, `login`, `organization`, `project`, and `done` states based on user input and validation results.

5. **Error Handling:**
   - Displays errors and exits the process if authentication fails irrecoverably.

# useClient Hook Documentation

## Overview

All three clients are a wrapper over `openapi-fetch` clients. These provide excellent typescript safety features.

The `useClient` hook exposes three methods to make api calls
1. `authenticatedApiClient`: If your component is wrapped in an `AuthProvider` use this method, it takes the context for `org_id`, `proj_id`, `env_id` and injects it in your path if needed. It also has the context for the `authToken` and you don't need to pass it to this method.
2. `authenticatedPdpClient`: Same functionality as `authenticatedApiClient` but you can pass an optional `pdp_url` while initializing the hook, otherwise it defaults to `https://cloudpdp.api.permit.io`.
3. `unAuthenticatedApiClient`: This is your normal api client, you need to pass all the necessary parameters manually.


## How to use it
All three of them are used in the same way, albeit having different use cases.
   1. Syntax:
      ```tsx
      const { authenticatedApiClient } = useClient();
      await authenticatedApiClient().POST(`path/xyz/{dynamic}`, // path
      	{ dynamic: 'dynamic_value' }, // path_values
      	{ key: value, uwu: owo}, // body
      	{ page: 10 } //query
      )
      ```
   2. Example:
	   ```tsx
       const { authenticatedApiClient } = useClient();
	   await authenticatedApiClient().GET(`/v2/api-key/{proj_id}/{env_id}`,
   		  { env_id: environmentId }
   	   )
	   ```
